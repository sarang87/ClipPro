Welcome to ClipPro. 

We offer a new solution to software engineers with busy lives. ClipPro has been tested by real engineers and each one of them uses it slightly differently.

Ways to use ClipPro:
	- Backend Dev copies all links, info, messages to clipboard without switching workspaces, apps or context. She then uses the COPY ALL button to save those links to notes. 

	- DevOps Dev is frequently switching between different projects and wants their clipboard to be clear. He copies a few links, copies them over to notes, clears his clipboard and switches tasks.

	- Linux Dev uses ClipPro as a simple clipboard, they select an entry 5 rows down and scrolls through their clipboard history to find the entries they need. 

More features:
	- Clipboard history saved in stack, most recent entry is at the top of clipboard history.
	- Save upto 100 entries in ClipPro itself
	

Enjoy ClipPro your way!
